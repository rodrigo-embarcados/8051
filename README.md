# 8051
This repository contains projects I've developed using a Chinese development board with the STC89C52RC microcontroller. 
These projects showcase my work with embedded systems, focusing on learning how to program for the 8051 architecture using SDCC as the compiler and stcgal to burn the .hex file. 
All projects were developed in a Linux environment. Each project includes a Makefile and a main.c file.

To burn the .hex file to the microcontroller, use the following commands:

    Burn: "make flash"

    Erase: "make clean"
